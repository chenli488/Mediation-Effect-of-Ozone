This is the sample R code to estimate causal mediation effects when using a BART (Bayesian Additive Regression Tree) as the mediator regression model.

The analysis from the manuscript "Temperature and Respiratory Emergency Department Visits: A Mediation Analysis with Ambient Ozone Exposure" can be 
reproduced by the code here.

The sample data is a simulated sample from the manuscript.
